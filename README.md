Take home interview data analysis

[Part A](https://github.com/nc-ds/b2bexample/blob/main/data-summary.R) is carried out in R with inline results to the questions asked.

[Part B]() is also carried out in R. 

Some EDA of orders and customers.

A basic [sales forecast]() is carried out for the number or daily orders using Prophet. There is a continuous increase in sales using this basic apporach. 

The next steps would be to look at a customer level to evaluate frequency, order size. Using a churn model to assess if the customer will shop in the upcoming purchase window, a conditional spend model is used to determine the spend of the customer if they do order. An outline is given but not carried out [here]().
